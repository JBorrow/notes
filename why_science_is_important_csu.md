Why Astronomy is Important: From Telescopes to Tears
========================

Talk for Cafe Scientifique Ustinov
----------------------------------

Introduction
------------

Hello, I'm Josh Borrow. I run the Cafe Scientifique in the centre of town, called Cafe Scientifique Durham City.
We run events every week that are similar to the ones put on here, however we have a much more informal approach.
I'll be talking today about why Astronomy is important and why it's important that the public are informed about Astronomy.
I'll also be talking a little about why it's important that you guys get involved in engaging the public with your research rather than leaving it to outreach professionals.

Astronomy and Worldview
-----------------------

Astronomy provdies us with some of the most powerful imagery in *literally* the whole Universe.
Images of galaxies that contain a million million suns really help us to put our lives in perspective, when we frame these ideas correctly.



Why Astronomy is Important: Practicalities
------------------------------------------

There are a bunch of practical reasons as to why it's important that we do Astronomy.
Astronomy is an incredibly important subject even within science itself.

In terms of direct outputs from Astronomy there are, of course, very few.
It's unlikely that if the only output from Astronomy was the basic research that is done on galaxy formation, for example, that the case could be made for funding it.
However, Astronomy is very rich in idirect outputs.

Wi-Fi, for example, is an indirect output from radio Astronomy.
In 1977, John O'Sullivan developed a method to sharpen images from a radio telescope.
This method can be applied to radio signals in general, and is now an integral part fo WLAN implenetations.

The IDL programming language is now used to analyse data from car crashes and was originally developed as a language to anlyse astronomical data.
It's also used by Texaco and BP to analyse core samples around oil fields as well as for general petroleum research.

GPS of course, is very much a space-centered project.
As well as benefiting from signal processing improvements that are integral to Astronomy, and the obvious aerospace challenges such a system presents which have been seen before in astronomy, GPS satellites are callibrated using astronomical objects.
Quasars and distant galaxies are used to help the GPS satellites determine accurate positions.
If Astronomers weren't there to discover these objects, study them and determine where they are in the sky to frankly unbelieveable accuracy then a lot of people would be getting lost on their way to a new out-of-town shopping centre.

In terms of medicine, Astronomy has literally saved lives.
The medical sector really relies on basic Astronomical research, not just for improvements in imaging techniques, but for less obvious improvements too.
For example, the development of satellites and space-based telescopes require incredibly clean environments.
The cleanroom protocols, air filtres and bunny suits that were developed for the incredibly clean conditions under which instruments for these spacecraft are now used in hospitals and pharmaceutical labs around the world.
Software processing techniques for processing satellite pictures taken from space are now helping medical researchers establish a simple method to implement wide-scale screening for AltzHeimers disease.

I could go on, for literally hours, about the economic outputs of basic Astronomical research and it's direct effect on society.
However, I'm sure that most of you are already aware of this.
I thought it might be more interesting to talk about another effect that Astronomy in particular has on society.


Why Bother Communicating Science?

Why should you communicate your science, rather than professionals?
